# [May 2023][newsletter] pyhf Project Update

We're happy to announce that [pyhf v0.7.1](https://github.com/scikit-hep/pyhf/releases/tag/v0.7.1) is out on PyPI and Conda-forge ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/pyhf_/status/1644302248040857600))!
This is a small patch release with the following highlights:

* All backends (SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) are now fully compatible and tested with Python 3.11.
* The tensorflow extra ('pyhf[tensorflow]') now automatically installs [tensorflow-macos](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow-macos/) for Apple silicon machines.
